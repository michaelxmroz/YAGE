# Rules for the Emulator Core

- Do not use any STD/STL functions. THe emulator core has to be able to run in a freestanding environment
- Do not use any STD error handling
- If you have to use a simple std function consider adding it to [CppIncludes.h](mdc:src/YAGECore/Source/CppIncludes.h) for both the freestanding case by using an intrinsic, and the non-freestandign case by using the std version
