# Project Build and Test rules

- ALWAYS after writing code in src\YAGECore or src\YAGEFrontend, ALWAYS verify that your changes compile by running @build_emulator.bat. This has to be done from the build\visualstudio\ folder. Do not forget this! It is very very important!
-  Whenever you change files from src\YAGECore or src\YAGEFrontend, ALWAYS run the emulator accuracy tests by first running @build_tests.bat and then @run_tests.bat. This has to be done from the build\visualstudio\ folder. Currently the test intr_2_mode0_timing_sprites.gb is broken and a fail there is expected.
-  Whenever you change files from src\YAGEOS, ALWAYS verify that your changes compile by running @build_zig.bat. This has to be done from the build\zig\ folder.

# C++ Programming Guidelines

- Whenever you add a new file, make sure to add it to the correct *.vcxproj and *.vcxproj.filters file. Always use the $(BaseItemPath) variable in the project files instead of using the full path.
- Please adhere to the already present coding style whenever possible.
- Please do not leave overly wordy comments. Only leave comments if the code itself is not self-explanatory, has to perform some unusual or unexpected function, or for marking TODOs.
- Unless asked to, do not touch code unrelated to your current task.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
